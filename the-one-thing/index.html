              <p>The ONE Thing é um livro que comecei a ler inspirado na dica do Robin Wieruch, que já leu um ou dois livros que eu também já li. Este é um clássico da auto-ajuda empresarial e começa ensinando umas poucas e boas para o leitor comum, mas é particularmente inspirador para quem já sabe que as lições de Gary Keller servem mais para ele do que para qualquer outro ser humano no planeta.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Going small&quot; is ignoring all the things you could do and doing what you should do.</li>
<li>There will always be just a few things that matter more than the rest, and out of those, one will matter most. Internalizing this concept is like being handed a magic compass. Whenever you feel lost or lacking direction, you can pull it out to remind yourself to discover what matters most.</li>
<li>Once you've figured out what actually matters, keep asking what matters most until there is only one thing left. That core activity goes at the top of your success list.</li>
<li>Say no. Whether you say &quot;later&quot; or &quot;never,&quot; the point is to say &quot;not now&quot; to anything else you could do until your most important work is done.</li>
<li>Don't get trapped in the &quot;check off&quot; game. If we believe things don't matter equally, we must act accordingly.</li>
<li>The truth is that things don't matter equally and success is found in doing what matters most.</li>
<li>You don't need to be a disciplined person to be successful. In fact, you can become successful with less discipline than you think, for one simple reason: success is about doing the right thing, not about doing everything right.</li>
<li>The payoff from developing the right habit is pretty obvious. It gets you the success you're searching for. What sometimes gets overlooked, however, is an amazing windfall: it also simplifies your life. Your life gets clearer and less complicated because you know what you have to do well and you know what you don't. The fact of the matter is that aiming discipline at the right habit gives you license to be less disciplined in other areas.</li>
<li>When you do the right thing, it can liberate you from having to monitor everything.</li>
<li>Australian researchers Megan Oaten and Ken Cheng have even found some evidence of a halo effect around habit creation. In their studies, students who successfully acquired one positive habit reported less stress; less impulsive spending; better dietary habits; decreased alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine consumption; fewer hours watching TV; and even fewer dirty dishes. Sustain the discipline long enough on one habit, and not only does it become easier, but so do other things as well. It's why those with the right habits seem to do better than others. They're doing the most important thing regularly and, as a result, everything else is easier.</li>
<li>So how do you put your willpower to work? You think about it. Pay attention to it. Respect it. You make doing what matters most a priority when your willpower is its highest. In other words, you give it the time of day it deserves.</li>
<li>What taxes your willpower: Implementing new behaviors, filtering distractions, resisting temptation, suppressing emotion, restraining aggression, suppressing impulses, taking tests, trying to impress others, coping with fear, doing something you don't enjoy, selecting long-term over short-term rewards.</li>
<li>When you gamble with your time, you may be placing a bet you can't cover. Even if you're sure you can win, be careful that you can live with what you lose.</li>
<li>When you're supposed to be working, work, and when you're supposed to be playing, play. It's a weird tightrope you're walking, but it's only when you get your priorities mixed up that things fall apart.</li>
<li>No one knows their ultimate ceiling for achievement, so worrying about it is a waste of time.</li>
<li>When you allow yourself to accept that big is about who you can become, you look at it differently.</li>
<li>Big ideas: think big, avoid incremental thinking that simply asks, &quot;What do I do next?&quot;, this is at best the slow lane to success and, at worst, the off ramp. Ask bigger questions.</li>
<li>A good rule of thumb is to double down everywhere in your life. If your goal is ten, ask the question: &quot;How can I reach 20?&quot; Set a goal so far above what you want that you'll be building a plan that practically guarantees your original goal.</li>
<li>Here's what I found out: We overthink, overplan, and overanalyze our careers, our businesses, and our lives; that long hours are neither virtuous nor healthy; and that we usually succeed in spite of most of what we do, not because of it. I discovered that we can't manage time, and that the key to success isn't in all the things we do but in the handful of things we do well.</li>
<li>Mark Twain agreed with Carnegie and described it this way: The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret to getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks and then starting on the first one.</li>
<li>Voltaire once wrote, &quot;Judge a man by his questions rather than his answers.&quot;</li>
<li>Sir Francis Bacon added, &quot;A prudent question is one-half of wisdom.&quot;</li>
<li>Indira Gandhi concluded that &quot;the power to question is the basis of all human progress.&quot;</li>
<li>The Focusing Question collapses all possible questions into one: &quot;What's the ONE Thing I can do / such that by doing it / everything else will be easier or unnecessary?&quot;</li>
